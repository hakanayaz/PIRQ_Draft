## t|ket> 

`t|ket>` is a set of quantum programming tools written in C++ by Cambridge Quantum Computing. Click [HERE](https://github.com/CQCL/tket) for more information.


## pytket
`pytket` is a python module to interface with `t|ket>`.

## Circuit Creation to Backend Execution
As you have likely notficed, tket involves many different software tools and quantum backends. Its usefulness comes from being able to create a quantum circuit in one software development kit (SDK), and then execute it on a backend from a different provider. For example, you may have the following sequence:

1. Qiskit Circuit

2. Qiskit Circuit **to** Pytket Circuit.

3. Execute circuit on Q# Simulator. **PICTURE HERE.**

This is one of **MANY** sequences you can do. To understand the other possible sequences from **circuit creation to backend execution**, we must understand the software tools and quantum backends suppoerted by `pytket`. Here is a simple high level diagram showing you the interoperability of all these software tools and backends.

For example, lets take a look at the top leftmost box. 
1. **pytket-cirq** is the pytket extension
2. **Cirq** is the SDK.
3. **Cirq Sim** is the Cirq simulated backend. 

The bi-directional arrow indicates we can:
1. Convert a **Cirq circuit** into a **pytket circuit**.
2. Convert a **pytket circuit** into a **Cirq circuit**. 

We could, the following sequence: 
1. Create Cirq circuit --> Convert to pytket circuit --> Run on **ANY** backend(i.e. IBMQ Device, IonQ Device, AQT Device, etc.)

The key here is, once you have a pytket circuit, you can execute the pytket circuit on any backend of your choosing. There are many possibilities from **circuit creation to backend execution!** Click [HERE](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket/blob/main/examples/backends_example.ipynb) to see an example of a pytket circuit ran on multiple backends.
