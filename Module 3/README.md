# Module 3

The goal of Module 3 is to demonstrate hybrid quantum-classical compilation capabilities. We begin by examining how the quantum part of a QAOA changes each iteration in order to determine which elements of compilation and transpilation can be performed once and which must be re-performed each iteration.
