## Module 1

Module one is about classical computers compilation process and use C/C++, Rust, and Python high level programming languages.

## Intermadiate Representation

Intermediate representation (IR) is the representation between source and target languages. Another way of saying IR is the data structure or code used by compilers or virtual machines to represent source code.

Another way of designing the IR is creating independent source and target languages which could be use to build while family of compiler.

Intermadiate representation provides a customary platform to share acros target and sources and allows re-use in compiler machinery.
