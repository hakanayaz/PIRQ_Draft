While using `rust` we need to look at a number of types that are built into the language. You can find this useful:
[Rust Data Type](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/second-edition/ch03-02-data-types.html)

Most important thing in `rust` is be careful about the definition.
