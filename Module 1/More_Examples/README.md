# More Examples

We include a few more sets of examples to see how IR interfaces with more complex features of high-level languages. We provide a brief overview here, with more detailed explanations within each folder.

## 2. The Newton-Raphson Method

The [Newton-Raphson Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) for root-finding gives a convenient example for the use of conditionals, loops, and function calls. Its pseudocode is to:

```
Guess a root, x
Evaluate f at x and at f'
Use x - f(x)/f'(x) as your next guess
Continue until you're close to a root
```

## 3. Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a very popular programming paradigm used in C++, Java, Python, and others. It allows for much higher levels of abstraction while coding then languages like C provide. In this set of tutorials, we look at how compilation deals with it, through a simple motivating example.
