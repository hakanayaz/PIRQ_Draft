# See Jupyter Notebook

For this tutorial, see [qubit.ipynb](qubit.ipynb). It will help to have [Julia installed](https://julialang.org/downloads/) in order for it to be interactive. For more information on how to integrate Julia with Jupyter, see the [Julia tutorial](../../../1_Simple_Function/Julia/) in `1_Simple_Function`. However, if you would prefer to go through this tutorial without Julia installed, all of the relevant results will be embedded in the notebook as well, so you can still learn about the process without running the code snippets.
