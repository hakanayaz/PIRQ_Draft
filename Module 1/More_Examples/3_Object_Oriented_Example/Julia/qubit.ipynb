    "As can be seen, the Julia AST is among the longer ones we've seen. It's > 100 lines for a fairly short code snippet. However, that is offset by how human-readable it is. It is much more minimal than clang's AST, for example; while that had many different types of nodes, each with many different attributes, Julia internally handles most functionality under the single `Expr` node. For example, both assignment operations and function calls are treated identically as `Expr` subtrees, where the `Head` value specifies the operation to be performed and the arguments (for function calls) or operands (for assignments) are stored as children. Even the struct definition is classified as an `Expr`. Finally, it is worth noting that this AST does indeed make use of all of the `\\n` tokens we saw earlier, and a fair amount of the nodes are `LineNumberNode`s."
