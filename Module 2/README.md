# Module 2

 Quantum computers intermediate representations (IR) tutorials and explanations

 While we are creating Quantum IR we will use current approaches to see try and if there is any imlementable approach we will implement the main quantum IR part.

 In this module we will start with the Quantum parsers, ASTs', gate optimizations, directed acyclic graph (DAG) integration, creating passes, and optimizing the qubit gate operations.

Suggestions:\

1) Quantum parser and AST's

ANTLR
OpenQASM

2) Transpilation and Optimization with different architecture

Gate optimization with DAG

Layout Design

Noise Optimization

3) QIR with Different Architecture

4) QHAL (Quantum Hardware Abstraction Layer)

Creating Dummy Superconductor Backend
