# Quantum Lexical Analysis and Parse Trees: OpenQASM

This section explains [how OpenQASM uses the ANTLR4 tool](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/tree/main/source/grammar) to generate a lexer and parser. We use this as an example for how quantum concepts and constructs can be supported through the compilation process, starting from the most foundational step: tokens and grammars.

## Sample OpenQASM Code

We will use the sample code found in `bell.qasm`, which generates Bell states:

```c
qreg q[2];                  // create a quantum register with 2 qubits
creg c[2];                  // create a classical register with 2 bits
U(pi/2, 0, pi) q[0];        // perform Hadamard gate on one qubit
CX q[0],q[1];               // perform control-not gate on both qubits
// z q[1];
// an entangled state of the Bell-pair form has been created!
  
measure q[0] -> c[0];       //measure one qubit, and put outcome in one bit
measure q[1] -> c[1];       //measure the other qubit, and put outcome in the other bit
```

## Deviations from Classical Program

First we will look to the .g4 file because this file contains the programming parser. Right off the bat, some things are apparent. A quantum coding language will require some quantum-specific keywords.

Here, we can notice that there are two different types of variables, `qreg` and `creg`. This is analogous to the typing system we are familiar with from classical computing, and can be dealt with in the same way during compilation. We can see this at work in `qasm3Lexer.g4`, where a new type token `qreg` is included among more familiar datatypes.

```c
/* Types. */

INPUT: 'input';
OUTPUT: 'output';
CONST: 'const';
MUTABLE: 'mutable';

QREG: 'qreg';
QUBIT: 'qubit';

CREG: 'creg';
BOOL: 'bool';
BIT: 'bit';
INT: 'int';
UINT: 'uint';
FLOAT: 'float';
...
```

We also see the `measure` operation, which is not something we concern ourselves with classically. There are a whole group of operations which are useful in quantum applications; they are reserved and given their own tokens by being built in to `qasm3Lexer.g4` file:

```c
/* Builtin identifiers and operations */

GPHASE: 'gphase';          // Applies a global phase
INV: 'inv';                // Modifies a gate and returns its Hermitian inverse
POW: 'pow';                // Modifies a gate U with U^k
CTRL: 'ctrl';              // Adds a classical control to a gate
NEGCTRL: 'negctrl';        // Negates the control, so that the gate triggers on 0 instead of1

DIM: '#dim';               //

DURATIONOF: 'durationof';  //

DELAY: 'delay';            // Allows for delays in circuit by applying I gate
RESET: 'reset';            // Resets a qubit to |0> state
MEASURE: 'measure';        // Measures the qubit
BARRIER: 'barrier';        // Allows for ordering constaint and disallows gate commutation

BooleanLiteral: 'true' | 'false';
```

## ANTLR4

We will now perform lexical analysis and generate a parse tree for this code, using ANTLR4. If you want to follow along, these resources may be helpful: [[1](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md)] [[2](http://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/source_code)].

1. The first thing you will need to do is [download and install Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html). Note that you may run into some compatibility issues: we recommend v11.0.2, which you can do through [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) or [OracleJDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/archive/).
    + Make sure you set your `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable to store the path where you saved your JDK.
    + Also, make sure you add this path + `\bin` to your `PATH`

This is a good place to stop and test. Type the command `java` into your command line. If it is not a recognized command, make sure your environmental variables are configured correctly. If you get usage tips - good job! Move on to the next step.

2. Once you have Java up and running, the next thing you will need is the actual ANTLR tool. You can download that [here](https://www.antlr.org/download.html). If you aim to follow along with the rest of this tutorial, download the complete binaries package for Java target, and save it into a convenient folder (if you already have one where you keep third party Java tools, that will work just fine).

3. The ANTLR tool needs to be added to the `CLASSPATH` environmental variable. Importantly, you have to add two paths: `.` and `path\to\antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar`. Note that these two commands are only temporary, and if you want to do this permanently you should either change in your `.bash_file` or in your Control Panel.
    + For Linux: `$ export CLASSPATH=".:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH"`
    + For Windows: `% SET CLASSPATH=.;C:\Javalib\antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar;%CLASSPATH%`

4. Set some convenient commands, so you don't have to type long paths over and over.

Linux:

```cmd
alias antlr4='java -Xmx500M -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.Tool'
alias grun='java -Xmx500M -cp "/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar:$CLASSPATH" org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig'
```

Windows:

```cmd
% doskey antlr4=java org.antlr.v4.Tool $*
% doskey grun=java org.antlr.v4.gui.TestRig $*
```

Now, we're ready to make sure everything is set up right and use ANTLR.

The easiest way to test this is to just try `antlr4` and `grun` in the command line. If you get notes on usage and flag options, you're good so far! Continue on. If your `java` command works, but either `antlr4` or `grun` either aren't recognized as commands or are throwing Java errors, turn to the [ANTLR FAQ](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/faq/installation.md).

Once these commands are working for you, we can put them to work on the qasm3 grammar. There are two .g4 files included in this repository, which between them build out the entire grammar. We will feed them to ANTLR one at a time, but first it's important to note that order matters. Why? Well, `qasm3Lexer.g4`, the file we peeked into earlier, defines all of the keywords and symbols available in OpenQasm 3.0. `qasm3Parser.g4` then uses those symbols and arranges them into rules, or _productions_, which specify what sort of grammatical combinations are allowed. At the very top of `qasm3Parser.g4` we see that it has a dependency on the lexer file:

```cmd
options {
    tokenVocab = qasm3Lexer;
}
```

So, it is important that we first run ANTLR on the lexer.

We can do that by running `antlr4 qasm3Lexer.g4` and `antlr4 qasm3Parser.g4` in order to generate all of the `.interp`, `.tokens`, and `.java` files we need. If you have any errors at this step, turn back to the [FAQ](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/faq/installation.md). In particular, make sure your `CLASSPATH` is set completely correctly - that little `.` at the beginning is important!

Now, assuming that worked, the hard part is done. We next compile all of the `.java` files ANTLR conveniently generated for us with `javac qasm3*.java` in order to turn them all into executable `.class` files. Finally, `grun`, the test rig we will be using, expects two arguments: a `grammarName` and a `startingRuleName`. Our `grammarName` is simly `qasm3`. Since we have a complete program, rather than a sub-production such as a single `breakStatement` or a `gateCallStatement`, we need to target the highest level rule in the grammar. If we look in the `qasm3Parser.g4` file, we will see that the `program: version? statement* EOF;` rule or production is the highest tier. Now, we have everything we need to proceed.

## Lexical Analysis

First, we want to see how the lexer works. Since we've already done the hard work of generating and compiling all of the necessary files, this is pretty simple. We run the command `grun qasm3 program -tokens` and then simply copy and paste our Bell state generator as input. (Remember to end with an EOF character: `Ctrl+D` on Linux, and `Ctrl+Z` for Windows! The program will simply hang and await more input until you put this.) The output for our program is attached below:

Each line gives the token number (there are 66 of then) and the character numbers which comprise it (for example, `OPENQASM` is the first 8 characters, or 0-7). It gives the string representation of the token, the type of token it is (for example, Token 2 = 3.0 is a `VersionSpecifier`, and not a `FloatLiteral`), and then the location in our file where it can be found. This is all information which will be helpful throughout the rest of compilation.

## Parse Tree

We're also interested in the Parse Tree generated by this program. We can try to run `grun qasm3 program -tree`, although in text format, this tree does not look pretty - we will not attach it here, but just trust me, you don't want to see it. Luckily, ANTLR provides us with a nice GUI which makes this a bit clearer. With `grun qasm3 program -gui`, we will get the following:

![Bell Program Parse Tree](bell_parse_tree.png)

We can see how the top level `program` production is split into its `version?` specifier, a series of `statement`s, and then the EOF delimiter: exactly as specified in the `qasm3Parser.g4`. It is instructive to trace down some of the statements in order to see how arguments are structured unambigously, and which sub-productions are necessary. This Parse Tree also begins to hint at how an IR might be generated.

## IR

For the final phase, we will use qcor to generate the LLVM. (INSERT TUTORIAL/EXPLANATION)
