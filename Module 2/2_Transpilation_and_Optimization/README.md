# 2. Transpilation and Optimization



## Qiskit Transpiler
This section focuses heavily on Qiskit's transpiler and its built in optimization passes

with an eye towards showing how the transpiler can be customized for any use case. 
## Qiskit vs. qcor Optimization
We also delve into the optimizations offered by qcor's MLIR tool, and compare them in detail with those Qiskit is able to perform. 
## Future Plans
In the future, we hope to investigate the optimizations qcor's quantum C++ compiler can perform, as well as add experimentation and tutorials on optimizations offered by pytket and the Q# compiler, and perhaps others
