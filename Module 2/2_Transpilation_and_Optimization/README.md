# 2. Transpilation and Optimization

Optimization is always important, but in quantum computing it is downright crucial. While classical optimization might conserve memory or speed up execution, it rarely has a direct effect on the correctness of an algorithm's results. In quantum computing, however, noise, error rates, and short decoherence times mean that optimizations can make a real difference between receiving a desired output and an unintelligible mix of garbage. Because of this, it must play a central role in any quantum compilation pipeline. Here, we experiment with several tools, although there are many more which are worth spending time with.

## Qiskit Transpiler

We leverage Qiskit's [library of prebuilt transpiler passes](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler_passes.html) in order to demonstrate the complexity and value of quantum optimization. [This Jupyter notebook](Transpilation_Process_Gate_Optimization.ipynb) gives a detailed walkthrough of the transpilers capabilities, with DAG integration and result comparisons.

## qcor Optimizations

The qcor-mlir-tool which was used in [previous examples](../1_Intro_Quantum_Parsers_and_ASTs/) offers optimizations as well, although of a different sort. [Here](2_qcor_Qiskit_Optimizations), we compare the optimizations performed by Qiskit with those offered by qcor's MLIR tool, each of which is important in its own right. That is analyzed in depth in the [qcor Qiskit Optimizations](2_qcor_Qiskit_Optimizations) directory.
 
## Future Plans

In the future, we hope to investigate the optimizations qcor's quantum C++ compiler can perform, as well as add experimentation and tutorials on optimizations offered by pytket and the Q# compiler, and perhaps others.
