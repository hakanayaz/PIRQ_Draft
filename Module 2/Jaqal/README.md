# Jaqal

Just Another Quantum Assembly Language (JAQAL) is the assembly language used to execute code on the Quantum Scientific Computing Open User Testbed (QSCOUT). QSCOUT is a trapped-ion quantum computer testbed operated by Sandia National Laboratories.

## JaqalPaq

JaqalPaq is a python package for meta-programming with Jaqal. It can parse, manipulate, emulate and generate the quantum assembly code. To install JaqalPaq, you can use this 3 step installation guide. [JaqalPaq Installation](https://gitlab.com/jaqal/jaqalpaq/-/tree/master/).

A code example is given in the jupyter notebook at the same directory.
