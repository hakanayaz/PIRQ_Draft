This section explains [how OpenQASM uses the ANTLR4 tool](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/tree/main/source/grammar) to generate a lexer and parser for their high-level imperative programming language. We use this is an example for how quantum concepts and constructs can be supported through the compilation process, starting from the most foundational step: tokens and grammars.
